# ArgParser
This is a lightweight C++ argument parser. No dependencies just a single header file you can copy into your project.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Copy the file**  
   Just copy `arg_parser.hpp` into your project. That's it it's a header-only library.
2. **Include it in your code**
   ```cpp
   #include "arg_parser.hpp"
   ```
